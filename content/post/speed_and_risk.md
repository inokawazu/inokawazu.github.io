# Fast and Furious

From time to time I feel the clock. 
The minute hand seems irresistible to look at.
I furiously type on my keyboard, trying to get finish *something* before a particular deadline.
The usual errors and warnings now seem infuriating.
The weight of tiredness builds on me where I can no longer focus, yet I push on.
