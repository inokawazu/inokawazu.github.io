# A Mathematical Anomaly

Einstein's theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) (GR) has done an excellent job in describing the classical gravity from [planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_motion) and [stellar dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stellar_dynamics) up through the dynamics of [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy), the [large-scale structure of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_universe), and [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole).
But, but the former, black holes represent a literal hole in our understanding of reality.
These gravitation objects contain a point of infinite curvature, singinally the incompleteness of GR, hinting at more fundemental principles that govern gravity and beyond.
For this article, I want to do my best explain how physics is currently trying to mathematically tame the black hole's singularity without using math AMAP[^amap].
On such method is to devised theories that *extend* GR to new theories of gravity where black holes become regular.
*Regular* black holes are black holes that do not have singularities.
