# War on Julia

Playing real war is no fun the card game called [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) is[^forthe].
It takes a while to play though so I thought how long would it at take on average.
To do this I programmed war on Julia.
Here is the [julia notebook code](./julia_card_war.jl)/[html view](/notebooks/julia_card_war.html).

On avrage it takes about $134$ turns but half the games take less than $100$ turns.
Half can go one for a long time.
Actually in war, one can draw, but this rare.
It only happens a few times out of a millions of games.

[^forthe]: For the first few times.
