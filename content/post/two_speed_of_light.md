# Enlightenment

Two videos came out ([Veritasium], [Dialect]) about measuring the **one-way** speed of light. Both are the usual fare for science videos, though [Dialect] is on the spicy side. For a bit of primer, the **one-way** speed of light is the distance traveled per time taken between two points. The **two-way** speed of light is the **round trip** distance traveled per time taken between two points. The aforementioned videos claim we cannot actually measure the **one-way** speed of light.

Nevertheless, I want to argue that this does not matter in modern physics theory. For light, predictions of physics would not change; i.e., the phenomenon of **one-way** light is not measurable. Modern physics is based on sophisticated math, but when does that pile of math ever mean *this is a measurable phenomenon*? This is important because physics theories have such *non-measurable* concepts. That is why, in physics jargon, there is a delineation between non-measurable and measurable.

The main category of non-measurable phenomena in physics is called **gauges**. I believe the **one-way** speed of light counts as a gauge.

<!-- This got me thinking about what's **measurable** in physics. -->
<!-- I think the question of knowing the **one-way** speed of light versus the **two-way** speed of light touches on this, in my opinion. -->

<!-- Nevertheless, we can ask why physicists are not concerned about the **one-way** speed of light and we [^metoo] do not rewrite the physics of relativity. -->
<!-- I would like to argue that the fact that the **one-way** speed of light is not necessary to know in physics. -->
<!-- I want to first start with introducing a concept called a **gauge**. -->

# What is a Gauge?

Physics theories are not *100%* efficient in their descriptions. In a sense, they overshoot. There is a [redundancy] in the number of parameters really needed in general. For example, from Newtonian mechanics, the *absolute* total energy is redundant. Case in point, I could state that an apple that is motionless [^motionless] on some table has **tens of millions of Joules** of energy. I could also say that the same apple has **zero Joules** of energy. In both cases, if we were to quickly remove the table, the apple's motion would be described in the same way in Newtonian physics.

[^motionless]: Motionless with respect to its surroundings.

[redundancy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory

How does this make sense?

What does it then mean for bombs and bonds to have tremendous energies compared to the lethargic motionless apple with "no energy"?

This makes sense because the motion of objects in Newtonian mechanics only cares about the *change/difference* of energy. The absolute value of energy is thus redundant. Our apple starts out motionless and then begins to fall because of the pull of gravity. The gravity is said to do work on the apple, causing its energy to increase! The apple's kinetic energy [kinetic-energy] increases.

[kinetic-energy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy

It is meaningful to say something has "lots of energy" because (with a small perturbation) it can *naturally* evolve to a state where it has a lot of kinetic energy. Things that move fast compared to you hit hard! Kinetic energy has a special property in physics: it has a lower bound. Motionless objects (with zero kinetic energy) can only be pushed or pulled into motion, increasing their kinetic energy.

Absolute energy in Newtonian mechanics is an example of a gauge in physics. A particular value of absolute energy does not change observations, so it's said to be unobservable.

# One-Way Speed of Light

I would claim this *choice of gauge* applies to the two-way speed of light as well. Just like the apple, we care about the trajectories of analogous bodies in special relativity. One can construct cases where light speed is variable, but if these changes in light speed do not end up as changes in the predictions of the theory (changes in trajectories), I would say such one-way speed of light is a gauge.

For convenience, I would say to choose the one-way light-speed gauge to make looking at the physics easier and more insightful. Nevertheless, parting ways from the assumptions of [special relativity could be useful].

<!-- There are cases possibly where this does matter, but for special relativity, this should not matter. -->

<!-- Speed of light (1) -->
<!-- : The speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum. -->

<!-- Speed of light (2) -->
<!-- : The speed at which all **massive** observers agree on its value. -->

<!-- <br> -->  

<!-- The definition (1) is related to some constants of nature that are found in Maxwell's field equations. -->
<!-- Definition (2) can be different at least logically. -->
<!-- For the universe we live in, it is a coincidence that the speeds of definition (1) and definition (2) coincide. -->

<!-- [^metoo]: I am a physicist after all ðŸ˜‰. -->
<!-- <!-1- [^atleast]: At least I can come up with. -1-> -->
